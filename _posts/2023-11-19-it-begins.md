There's not a better way to put this, so here it goes:

I have a blog now.

It is tiny, and I love this because it tends to get really big and scary inside my head so it's nice to have somewhere nice and cozy and with my thoughts in it to visit.

This is very much inspired in Stuffed Wombat's [blog](http://stuffedwomb.at){:target="_blank"}, which is also tiny and cute.

You may be under the impression I find minimalism cute;  
I'm afraid you'd be wrong.

I like me some crunchy pixels and busy backgrounds as much as the other guy.

It's just that the abscence of detail is what makes these minimalistic spaces somewhere to go to ponder; a blank slate for the mind.

Even though I'm happy to have somewhere to write, though, this has been a day of veiled progress. My intention was not to setup a blog, but to get started on my next game project. This is a blog about games, you'd (mostly correctly) assume.

I've had quite a number of projects in the past, though I invite you to take a look at the list of my [games](/stuff.html). You'll notice I haven't had much progress in the, well, _progress_ side of things.

A change is needed.  
It might just be this blog.

Even though I entered college in 2010 with the hopes of being a game developer one day, I just started to delve into gamedev after my cancer diagnosis in 2015. I had leukemia and have thankfully beaten it after a couple of years of treatment.

During that time of isolation, though, what kept my programming skills from fading away was discovering how I could make games with it; [Monogame](https://monogame.net/){:target="_blank"} being my choice of framework then and ever since.

I made multiple RPG prototypes, some puzzles, sims and even explored a bit of multiplayer coding with [Lidgren](https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3){:target="_blank"}.  

What is that?  
_Finishing a game_?  
Well that's rich.

The first time someone _played_ something I did was when I decided to _make small games™_ (I made one; the one I'm describing) and made a _wizardboy_-themed memory game for my wife and a friend. I kept developing the game while they played the latest version as I fixed bugs and added more images.  
Sadly, I never published it and they're the only ones who played it.

The second and _only_ game I made that is available is _A Promise for Ox_; a tiny bullet hell game that I literally promised I'd develop and publish in 2018, and started in December 28th.

<br/>
<sub>The last upload was on December 30th, the verge of the deadline; I live dangerously</sub>
</p>

The game lacks a bit when it comes to design, art, gameplay and sound. But I made it.  
Some friends played and laughed as they competed on who survived the longest.  
That day was awesome and it was totally worth it.

I made some comics about nothing in particular.  
I painted a canvas once.  
I tattooed myself and my wife two times.  
I recorded a theme song for a game that never existed.

I am a starter, but I don't stick with any of it. _I hate that_.

I want to create a game again. Not as a promise or to make my friends laugh. I just want to kill this inertia I'm sitted in _again_ and start making stuff as I once did. And stick to it.

To all of it.

Whoever read this in the future will be witness to how my endeavors went, even if it's just my future, slightly more degraded self.

So.  
__Did I do it?__
