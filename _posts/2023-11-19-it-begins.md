There's not a better way to put this, so here it goes:

I have a blog now.

It is tiny, and I love this because it tends to get really big and scary inside my head so it's nice to have somewhere nice and cozy and with my thoughts in it to visit.

This is very much inspired in Stuffed Wombat's [blog](http://stuffedwomb.at){:target="_blank"}, which is also tiny and cute.

You may be under the impression I find minimalism cute;  
I'm afraid you'd be wrong.

I like me some crunchy pixels and busy backgrounds as much as the other guy.

It's just that the abscence of detail is what makes these minimalistic spaces somewhere to go to ponder about stuff; a blank slate for the mind, perhaps.

This has been a day of veiled progress. My intention was not to setup a blog, but to get started on my next game project.

You see, I've had quite a number of projects in the past; I invite you to take a look in my [games]({{ link /games.html }}) page, though. You'll notice I haven't had much progress in the, well, _progress_ side of things.

A change is needed.  
It might just be this blog.

I've started to delve into gamedev after my cancer diagnosis. I had leukemia in 2015 and have thankfully beaten after a couple of years.

During that time, though, what kept my programming skills from fading was mainly discovering that I could make games with it; [Monogame](https://monogame.net/){:target="_blank"} being my choice of framework ever since.

I made multiple RPG prototypes, some puzzles and even explored a bit of multiplayer coding with [Lidgren](https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3){:target="_blank"}.  
Finishing a game? That's rich.

The first time someone played something I did was when I decided to _make small games™_ (I made one; the one I'm describing) and finished a _wizardboy_-themed memory game for my wife and a friend. I kept developing the game while they played the latest version as I fixed bugs and added more images.  
Sadly, they're the only ones who saw it.

The second and _only_ game I made available for show is _A Promise for Ox_; a game that I literally promised I'd develop and publish in 2018, and started in December 28th.

<sub>The last upload was on December 30th, the verge of the deadline; I live dangerously</sub>
</p>

The game lacks a bit when it comes to design, art, gameplay and sound. But I made it.  
Some friends played and laughed.  
That was awesome and it was totally worth it.

I made some comics about nothing in particular.
I painted a canvas once.
I tattooed myself and my wife two times.
I recorded a theme song for a game that never existed.

I am a starter, but I don't stick with any of it. _I hate that_.

I want to create a game again. Not necessarily with a promise or to make my friends laugh. I just want to kill this inertia I'm sitted in _again_ and start making stuff as once I did. And stick to it.

To all of it.

Whoever read this in a future date will be witness to how my endeavors went, even if it is just myself.

So.  
__Did I do it?__
