There's not a better way to put it, so here it goes:

I have a blog now.  
It is tiny, and I love this because it tends to get really big and scary inside my head so it's nice to have something nice and cozy and with my thoughts to visit.

This is very much inspired in Stuffed Wombat's [blog](http://stuffedwomb.at){:target="_blank"}, which is also tiny and cute.

You may have the impression that I might found minimalism cute;  
you'd be wrong.

I like me some crunchy pixels and busy backgrounds as much as the other guy.

It's just that the abscence of detail is what makes these minimalistic spaces somewhere to go to ponder about stuff; a blank slate for the mind, perhaps.
